# CadetsMakeExcellentTrainingTrackers
Fill out the Cadet Military Education Training Tracker (CMETT) for me from FalconNet data

# Todo
1. Given a training date, download accountability reports from FalconNet
2. Given an accountability report, parse out cadets who have completed training
3. Map training objectives provided by the user to FalconNet events (ideally in persistent storage)
4. Aggregate data on attendees, completed objectives, and dates to auto-populate dates and trainer initials into CMETT excel trackers
5. Receive makeup training data from a user. Given attendees and the original event they are making up, sign them for the training objectives they made up
6. Allow the user to define one-off trainings (cadets + objectives + date) and generate signatures.
7. Generate reports and emails for overdue trainings
